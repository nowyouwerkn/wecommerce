# Image-Uploader
Image-Uploader is a simple jQuery Drag & Drop Image Uploader plugin made to be used in forms, without AJAX.

## Important notice
This plugin uses the [DataTransfer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/DataTransfer). Therefore, is not a Cross Browser solution. Everything works fine on Chrome, though. See #3 for more details. If this is not a problem to you, feel free to enjoy the plugin.
